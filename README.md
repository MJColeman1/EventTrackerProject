# Event Tracker Project

## Week 12 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Description
The objective of this project is to create a workout tracker so a user can track information about their exercise habits such as: what days they went to the gym, their arrival time, the muscle group that was exercised, total number of exercises performed, total number of repetitions conducted, total number of miles ran, any personal records achieved, and the time the user left the gym.

#### How To Run This Application
To run this application, go to http://18.188.70.118:8080/EventTracker/ which will take you to the homepage of the workout tracker. Once the user has done that, they will see the option to search for a previous workout by ID number (ID numbers are dynamically generated after a new workout is created with the first workout inserted possessing an ID of 1 and ascending from there). Below the search option the user will see all of their previously entered workouts and the user can simply click on one to get an expanded view, which displays all details of the workout that the user entered. In this expanded view, the user will also be presented with a form to update that specific workout. To update the workout details, simply fill out the form and select 'Update Workout'. The user will also see a 'delete' button next to each workout which allows them to delete a workout.
