# Event Tracker Project

## Week 11 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Description
The objective of this project is to create a workout tracker so a user can track information about their exercise habits such as: what days they went to the gym, their arrival time, the muscle group that was worked, total number of exercises performed, total number of repetitions conducted, total number of miles ran, any personal records achieved, and the time the user left the gym.

#### How To Run This Application
Currently, this application does not have a user interface to interact with. This application contains multiple REST APIs necessary for full CRUD functionality. This application will have a fully functioning user interface soon and users will be able to start keeping track of their exercise habits!

#### Technologies Used
* Spring Boot
* Spring Data JPA
* Spring Rest Controllers
* J-Unit Tests
* Java Persistence API
* Interfaces (JPA Repository, Services)
* Gradle for Dependency Management
* MySQL Workbench for Database Creation
* Entity Classes
